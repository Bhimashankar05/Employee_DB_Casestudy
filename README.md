# Employee Database Case Study

I analyzed a dataset related to employee demographics and performance and performed the following steps:

Data Exploration: Reviewed the dataset structure, data types, and identified missing values.  
Data Cleaning: Handled missing data and ensured the dataset was properly formatted for analysis.  
Statistical Insights: Calculated key metrics, such as average tenure, salary distribution, and performed grouped analyses (e.g., performance by department or age group).  
Visualization: Used visual tools to explore distributions, identify trends, and analyze relationships between variables like employee satisfaction, performance, and department.  
Documentation: Compiled findings for clarity, ensuring they are reproducible and ready for sharing on Kaggle or GitHub.
