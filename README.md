# Employee Database Case Study

I analyzed a dataset related to employee demographics and performance and performed the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: Reviewed the dataset structure, data types, and identified missing values.  
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing data and ensured the dataset was properly formatted for analysis.  
3. **Statistical Insights**: Calculated key metrics, such as average tenure, salary distribution, and performed grouped analyses (e.g., performance by department or age group). 
4. **Visualization**: Used visual tools to explore distributions, identify trends, and analyze relationships between variables like employee satisfaction, performance, and department.  
5. **Documentation**: Compiled findings for clarity, ensuring they are reproducible and ready for sharing on Kaggle or GitHub.
